# WWDC_2018
## my WWDC 2018 scholarship submission [rejected]

Hello World 👋🏻,

my goal was to create a playground that can regognize your handwirting and create a 3D text from the words you write in the canvas. The 3D text can be placed into the real world with AR. 

I hope you like the project, I tryed my best but nerver worked with swift playgrounds before and used CoreML or ARKit before.

## The Handwriting ML

I used the emnist datastack for training my ML. It took some days on my macbook air for training but now it works great 😊.
