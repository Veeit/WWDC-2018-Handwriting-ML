 Hey Everyone at Apple👋🏻,
 
 I created this swift playground to show how CoreML and ARkit work together.
 So I created a canvas to allow you to draw letters by using your fingers. My CoreML model recognizes those letters and adds them together to words.
 
 This words will be transformed into 3D objects, which you can put into the real world by AR.
 
 Pleace remember, that this is my first playground, and it is my first time working with ARKit, SceneKit and CoreML! I enjoyed creating this for you😃.
 
 I hope you have fun with the playgorund and enjoy playing with it 🤗.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Veit
